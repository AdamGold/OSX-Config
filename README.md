These are some of my config files. What's better than a `git commit` as a backup? ðŸ˜ŽðŸ™Š

You're welcomed to copy the files. [Karabiner is awesome](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/).

| Key        |     Single Press      |          Long Press |
| ---------- | :-------------------: | ------------------: |
| CAPS LOCK  |        Escape         |                Ctrl |
| Left Shift |   Open parenthesis    | Tons of parenthesis |
| CMD + hjkl | Just like Vim's hjkl  |      hmmmm......... |
| CMD + b/e  | Back word/End of word |                     |

#### So how do you write IN CAPITAL LETTERS?

I hold down one of my shifts ðŸ•º

#### Suggestion: key repeat

I would suggest [modifying your key repeat rate](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/10):

```
defaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 10 # normal minimum is 15 (225 ms)
defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1 # normal minimum is 2 (30 ms)
```
